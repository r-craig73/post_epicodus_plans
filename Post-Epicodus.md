### Description
#### A specific summary planning my coding career beyond Epicodus summer 2018.

### Post Epicodus goals
After attending Epicodus, the main goal is to be hired in the technology field in the Pacific Northwest area. My programming resume will be updated and posted in Monster.com, Dice.com, Indeed.com and other websites.  While applying for technology jobs (technical support, mobile application developer, software engineer, QA engineer, IT, scrum program manager, etc.) in the Portland, Seattle and possible Vancouver, BC area, I will practice answering interview and technical questions with either a fellow cohort or tutor.  Coding skills (ABC - always be coding) will be improved by updating my Epicodus repository, reading Ruby/JavaScript/jQuery books, learning multiple programming languages (Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, jQuery, Python), and working on new fun projects. Finally, I will network in the real and digital world to promote my coding skills and experience.
